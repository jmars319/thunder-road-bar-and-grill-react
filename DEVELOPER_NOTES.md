Developer notes: nested frontend/backend folders

During development this repository acquired two nested folders that look like accidental local installs:

- `frontend/backend/` — contains an ad-hoc `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (devDependencies for ESLint). It appears to be a local linting/tooling install and not part of the site's backend.
- `backend/frontend/` — contains an ad-hoc `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (devDependencies for ESLint/React hooks linting).

Recommendations

1. These folders are not required by the application itself and can safely be removed from the repository. They are likely the result of running `npm install` inside those subfolders.

2. To remove them from Git but preserve local copies, use:

```bash
# stop tracking the package files
git rm --cached frontend/backend/package.json frontend/backend/package-lock.json
git rm --cached backend/frontend/package.json backend/frontend/package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: stop tracking accidental nested package.json files"
```

3. To delete the directories locally (free disk space):

```bash
rm -rf frontend/backend node_modules
rm -rf backend/frontend node_modules
```

4. If you intend these to be real subprojects, add a short README inside each explaining purpose and keep them tracked as proper package roots.
