## Unreleased - 2025-10-14

### Added
- `DEVELOPERS.md` — developer onboarding and reference for the frontend. Covers:
  - Theme tokens and runtime theming (ThemeContext)
  - Toast API (ToastContext)
  - Admin module registry/contract
  - Common API endpoints and testing instructions
  - Tailwind tokenization checklist

- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — release note for this documentation-focused update.
- `CHANGELOG-RELEASE-ENTRY.md` — per-release entry file (for machine-assisted workflows).

### Changed
- Repository-wide inline annotations added to many frontend components and
  admin modules to clarify data shapes, API expectations, and accessibility
  requirements.
- `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.js`: accessibility and UX improvements, including
  labeled inputs, `form` + `onSubmit`, aria-live error region, and defensive
  network handling.
- `frontend/src/pages/PublicSite.js`: added composition notes and accessibility
  suggestions (e.g. child components providing landmarks).

### Fixed
- `frontend/src/components/admin/NewsletterModule.js`: CSV export now wrapped
  in try/catch and delete failures log to console for easier debugging.

### Maintenance
- `DEVELOPERS.md` was added to consolidate onboarding information and common
  development commands.
- Tests run: `cd frontend && npm test -- --watchAll=false` — PASS (representative test).
