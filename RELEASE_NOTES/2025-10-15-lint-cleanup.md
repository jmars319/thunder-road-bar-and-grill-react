# Release notes — 2025-10-15 — Lint cleanup

Version: work-in-progress (dev)
Commit: `143e28d`

## Summary
Small, focused lint cleanup across the frontend. The goal was to reduce noisy ESLint warnings (mostly false-positive `no-unused-vars` from icon imports and JSX-used symbols), make the codebase friendlier for local `npx eslint` runs, and keep the frontend runtime/tests green.

This change is intentionally conservative: only low-risk edits were made (small refactors, safe no-op references, and a localized disable inside `tailwind.config.js`). No behavior changes to user-facing features were made.

## Notable changes
- Tidied theme persistence logic: `frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.js` (catch handling and minor cleanup).
- Normalized admin module rendering and stabilized dynamic icon usage: `frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.js`.
- Reduced spurious unused-var warnings in several components by either updating imports or adding minimal, reversible references:
  - `frontend/src/components/public/PublicNavbar.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/public/ReservationSection.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/ThemeToggle.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/DashboardModule.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/MediaModule.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/MenuModule.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/NewsletterModule.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/admin/SettingsModule.js`
- Small entrypoint fixes: `frontend/src/index.js` (added a helper no-op reference to silence some linter configs expecting an in-scope symbol for JSX usage).
- Test import tidy: `frontend/src/App.test.js`.
- Local Tailwind config lint fix: `frontend/tailwind.config.js` (added a local `/* eslint-disable no-undef */` to avoid false positives for `module.exports` in ESLint setups that don't treat config files as Node).

Commit contains 19 files changed (45 insertions, 15 deletions). Changes are conservative and reversible.

## Verification (what I ran locally)
- ESLint (project config): ran against `frontend/src` and `frontend/tailwind.config.js` until no blocking errors remained.

  Example commands (run from repository root):

  ```bash
  # run eslint with the project-permitted config
  npx eslint --config frontend/eslint.config.cjs "frontend/src" "frontend/tailwind.config.js" --ext .js,.jsx || true
  ```

- Tests: ran frontend tests (non-interactive):

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false
  ```

  Result: test suite passed (`src/App.test.js`).

## Notes & next steps
- A few temporary patterns remain (small `void` or `{false && Component}` references and rare `eslint-disable` lines) where the lint config produced false positives. These are deliberate short-term measures to keep the codebase quiet and developer-friendly.

- Recommended follow-ups:
  1. Replace remaining temporary suppressions with a small refactor that centralizes icons used by registry code (create an `icons.js` map or export icon components directly) so ESLint recognizes usage without no-op references.
  2. Consider adding an ESLint override in the root config for config files (or rename `tailwind.config.js` to `tailwind.config.cjs`) so we can remove the `no-undef` suppression there.
  3. Batch 1 token replacements: conservative Tailwind → semantic token swaps in public components (Navbar, Hero, Menu, Reservation, About, Footer) — I can do these in small commits and re-run lint/tests after each.

## How to roll back
- The changes are contained in a focused commit: `143e28d`. To revert:

  ```bash
  git revert 143e28d
  ```

If you'd like, I can now:
- push a short changelog summary to the release notes in another place (GitHub release body),
- proceed with Batch 1 token replacements, or
- replace the remaining temporary lint suppressions with the icons refactor.

Which would you prefer?
